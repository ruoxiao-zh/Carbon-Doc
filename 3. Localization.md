# Localization

With Carbon 2, localization changed a lot, 64 new locales are supported and we now embed locale formats, day names, month names, ordinal suffixes, meridiem, week start and more. While Carbon 1 provided partial support and relied on third-party like IntlDateFormatter class and language packages for advanced translation, you now benefit of a wide internationalization support. You still use Carbon 1? I hope you would consider to upgrade, version 2 has really cool new features. Else you still read the [version 1 documentation of Localization by clicking here](https://carbon.nesbot.com/docs/#localization-v1).

So, here is the new recommended way to handle internationalization with Carbon.

```php
$date = Carbon::now()->locale('fr_FR');

echo $date->locale();            // fr_FR
echo "\n";
echo $date->diffForHumans();     // il y a quelques secondes
echo "\n";
echo $date->monthName;           // août
echo "\n";
echo $date->isoFormat('LLLL');   // vendredi 24 août 2018 14:40
```

The `->locale()` method only change the language for the current instance and has precedence over global settings. We recommend you this approach so you can't have conflict with other places or third-party libraries that could use Carbon. Nevertheless, to avoid calling `->locale()` each time, you can use factories.

```php
// Let say Martin from Paris and John from Chicago play chess
$martinDateFactory = new Factory([
    'locale' => 'fr_FR',
    'timezone' => 'Europe/Paris',
]);
$johnDateFactory = new Factory([
    'locale' => 'en_US',
    'timezone' => 'America/Chicago',
]);
// Each one will see date in his own language and timezone

// When Martin moves, we display things in French, but we notify John in English:
$gameStart = Carbon::parse('2018-06-15 12:34:00', 'UTC');
$move = Carbon::now('UTC');
$toDisplay = $martinDateFactory->make($gameStart)->isoFormat('lll')."\n".
    $martinDateFactory->make($move)->calendar()."\n";
$notificationForJohn = $johnDateFactory->make($gameStart)->isoFormat('lll')."\n".
    $johnDateFactory->make($move)->calendar()."\n";
echo $toDisplay;
/*
15 juin 2018 12:34
Aujourd’hui à 14:40
*/

echo $notificationForJohn;
/*
Jun 15, 2018 12:34 PM
Today at 2:40 PM
*/
```

You can call any static Carbon method on a factory (make, now, yesterday, tomorrow, parse, create, etc.) Factory (and FactoryImmutable that generates CarbonImmutable instances) are the best way to keep things organized and isolated. As often as possible we recommend you to work with UTC dates, then apply locally (or with a factory) the timezone and the language before displaying dates to the user.

What factory actually do is using the method name as static constructor then call `settings()` method which is a way to group in one call settings of locale, timezone, months/year overflow, etc. ([See references for complete list.](https://carbon.nesbot.com/docs/#doc-method-Carbon-settings))

```php
$factory = new Factory([
    'locale' => 'fr_FR',
    'timezone' => 'Europe/Paris',
]);
$factory->now(); // You can recall $factory as needed to generate new instances with same settings
// is equivalent to:
Carbon::now()->settings([
    'locale' => 'fr_FR',
    'timezone' => 'Europe/Paris',
]);
// Important note: timezone setting calls ->shiftTimezone() and not ->setTimezone(),
// It means it does not just set the timezone, but shift the time too:
echo Carbon::today()->setTimezone('Asia/Tokyo')->format('d/m G\h e');        // 24/08 9h Asia/Tokyo
echo "\n";
echo Carbon::today()->shiftTimezone('Asia/Tokyo')->format('d/m G\h e');      // 24/08 0h Asia/Tokyo
```

Factory settings can be changed afterward with `setSettings(array $settings)` or to merge new settings with existing ones `mergeSettings(array $settings)` and the class to generate can be initialized as the second argument of the construct then changed later with `setClassName(string $className)`.

```php
$factory = new Factory(['locale' => 'ja'], CarbonImmutable::class);
var_dump($factory->now()->locale);                                           // string(2) "ja"
var_dump(get_class($factory->now()));                                        // string(22) "Carbon\CarbonImmutable"

class MyCustomCarbonSubClass extends Carbon { /* ... */ }
$factory
    ->setSettings(['locale' => 'zh_CN'])
    ->setClassName(MyCustomCarbonSubClass::class);
var_dump($factory->now()->locale);                                           // string(5) "zh_CN"
var_dump(get_class($factory->now()));                                        // string(22) "MyCustomCarbonSubClass"
```

Previously there was `Carbon::setLocale` that set globally the locale. But as for our other static setters, we highly discourage you to use it. It breaks the principle of isolation because the configuration will apply for every class that uses Carbon.

You also may know `formatLocalized()` method from Carbon 1\. This method still works the same in Carbon 2 but you should better use `isoFormat()` instead.

`->isoFormat(string $format): string` use ISO format rather than PHP-specific format and use inner translations rather than language packages you need to install on every machine where you deploy your application. `isoFormat` method is compatible with [momentjs format method](https://momentjs.com/), it means you can use same format strings as you may have used in moment from front-end or node.js. Here are some examples:

```php
$date = Carbon::parse('2018-06-15 17:34:15.984512', 'UTC');
echo $date->isoFormat('MMMM Do YYYY, h:mm:ss a'); // June 15th 2018, 5:34:15 pm
echo "\n";
echo $date->isoFormat('dddd');           // Friday
echo "\n";
echo $date->isoFormat('MMM Do YY');      // Jun 15th 18
echo "\n";
echo $date->isoFormat('YYYY [escaped] YYYY'); // 2018 escaped 2018
```

An other usefull translated method is `calendar($referenceTime = null, array $formats = []): string`:

```php
$date = CarbonImmutable::now();
echo $date->calendar();                                      // Today at 2:40 PM
echo "\n";
echo $date->sub('1 day 3 hours')->calendar();                // Yesterday at 11:40 AM
echo "\n";
echo $date->sub('3 days 10 hours 23 minutes')->calendar();   // Last Tuesday at 4:17 AM
echo "\n";
echo $date->sub('8 days')->calendar();                       // 08/16/2018
echo "\n";
echo $date->add('1 day 3 hours')->calendar();                // Tomorrow at 5:40 PM
echo "\n";
echo $date->add('3 days 10 hours 23 minutes')->calendar();   // Tuesday at 1:03 AM
echo "\n";
echo $date->add('8 days')->calendar();                       // 09/01/2018
echo "\n";
echo $date->locale('fr')->calendar();                        // Aujourd’hui à 14:40
```

If you know momentjs, then it works the same way. You can pass a reference date as second argument, else now is used. And you can customize one or more formats using the second argument (formats to pass as array keys are: sameDay, nextDay, nextWeek, lastDay, lastWeek and sameElse):

```php
$date1 = CarbonImmutable::parse('2018-01-01 12:00:00');
$date2 = CarbonImmutable::parse('2018-01-02 8:00:00');

echo $date1->calendar($date2, [
    'lastDay' => '[Previous day at] LT',
]);
// Previous day at 12:00 PM
```

Here is an overview of the 102 locales (and 137 regional variants) supported by the last Carbon version:

Note that if you use Laravel 5.5+, the locale will be automatically set according to current last `App:setLocale`execution. So `diffForHumans`, `isoFormat` and localized properties such as `->dayName` or `->monthName` will be localized transparently.

Each Carbon, CarbonImmutable, CarbonInterval or CarbonPeriod instance is linked by default to a`Carbon\Translator` instance according to its locale set. You can get and/or change it using `getLocalTranslator()`/`setLocalTranslator(Translator $translator)`.
