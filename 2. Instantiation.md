# Instantiation

There are several different methods available to create a new instance of Carbon. First there is a constructor. It overrides the [parent constructor](http://www.php.net/manual/en/datetime.construct.php) and you are best to read about the first parameter from the PHP manual and understand the date/time string formats it accepts. You'll hopefully find yourself rarely using the constructor but rather relying on the explicit static methods for improved readability.

```php
$carbon = new Carbon();                  // equivalent to Carbon::now()
$carbon = new Carbon('first day of January 2008', 'America/Vancouver');
echo get_class($carbon);                 // 'Carbon\Carbon'
```

You'll notice above that the timezone (2nd) parameter was passed as a string rather than a `\DateTimeZone`instance. All DateTimeZone parameters have been augmented so you can pass a DateTimeZone instance, string or integer offset to GMT and the timezone will be created for you. This is again shown in the next example which also introduces the `now()` function.

```php
$now = Carbon::now(); // will use timezone as set with date_default_timezone_set
// PS: we recommend you to work with UTC as default timezone and only use
// other timezones (such as the user timezone) on display

$nowInLondonTz = Carbon::now(new DateTimeZone('Europe/London'));

// or just pass the timezone as a string
$nowInLondonTz = Carbon::now('Europe/London');

// or to create a date with a timezone of +1 to GMT during DST then just pass an integer
$date = Carbon::now(1);
echo $date->tzName;                      // Europe/London
echo "\n";

// Get/set minutes offset from UTC
echo $date->utcOffset();                 // 60
echo "\n";

$date->utcOffset(180);

echo $date->tzName;                      // Europe/Helsinki
echo "\n";
echo $date->utcOffset();                 // 180
```

If you really love your fluid method calls and get frustrated by the extra line or ugly pair of brackets necessary when using the constructor you'll enjoy the `parse` method.

```php
echo (new Carbon('first day of December 2008'))->addWeeks(2);     // 2008-12-15 00:00:00
echo "\n";
echo Carbon::parse('first day of December 2008')->addWeeks(2);    // 2008-12-15 00:00:00
```

The string passed to `Carbon::parse` or to `new Carbon` can represent a relative time (next sunday, tomorrow, first day of next month, last year) or an absolute time (first day of December 2008, 2017-01-06). You can test if a string will produce a relative or absolute date with `Carbon::hasRelativeKeywords()`.

```php
$string = 'first day of next month';
if (strtotime($string) === false) {
    echo  "'$string' is not a valid date/time string.";
} elseif (Carbon::hasRelativeKeywords($string)) {
    echo  "'$string' is a relative valid date/time string, it will returns different dates depending on the current date.";
} else {
    echo  "'$string' is an absolute date/time string, it will always returns the same date.";
}
```

To accompany `now()`, a few other static instantiation helpers exist to create widely known instances. The only thing to really notice here is that `today()`, `tomorrow()` and `yesterday()`, besides behaving as expected, all accept a timezone parameter and each has their time value set to `00:00:00`.

```php
$now = Carbon::now();
echo $now;                               // 2018-08-24 14:40:29
echo "\n";
$today = Carbon::today();
echo $today;                             // 2018-08-24 00:00:00
echo "\n";
$tomorrow = Carbon::tomorrow('Europe/London');
echo $tomorrow;                          // 2018-08-25 00:00:00
echo "\n";
$yesterday = Carbon::yesterday();
echo $yesterday;                         // 2018-08-23 00:00:00
```

The next group of static helpers are the `createXXX()` helpers. Most of the static `create` functions allow you to provide as many or as few arguments as you want and will provide default values for all others. Generally default values are the current date, time or timezone. Higher values will wrap appropriately but invalid values will throw an `InvalidArgumentException` with an informative message. The message is obtained from an [DateTime::getLastErrors()](http://php.net/manual/en/datetime.getlasterrors.php) call.

```php
$year = 2000; $month = 4; $day = 19;
$hour = 20; $minute = 30; $second = 15; $tz = 'Europe/Madrid';
echo Carbon::createFromDate($year, $month, $day, $tz)."\n";
echo Carbon::createMidnightDate($year, $month, $day, $tz)."\n";
echo Carbon::createFromTime($hour, $minute, $second, $tz)."\n";
echo Carbon::createFromTimeString("$hour:$minute:$second", $tz)."\n";
echo Carbon::create($year, $month, $day, $hour, $minute, $second, $tz)."\n";
```

`createFromDate()` will default the time to now. `createFromTime()` will default the date to today. `create()` will default any null parameter to the current respective value. As before, the `$tz` defaults to the current timezone and otherwise can be a DateTimeZone instance or simply a string timezone value. The only special case is for `create()` that has minimum value as default for missing argument but default on current value when you pass explicitly `null`.

```php
$xmasThisYear = Carbon::createFromDate(null, 12, 25); // Year defaults to current year
$Y2K = Carbon::create(2000, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0); // equivalent to Carbon::createMidnightDate(2000, 1, 1)  
$alsoY2K = Carbon::create(1999, 12, 31, 24); 
$noonLondonTz = Carbon::createFromTime(12, 0, 0, 'Europe/London'); 
$teaTime = Carbon::createFromTimeString('17:00:00', 'Europe/London'); 

try { 
    Carbon::create(1975, 5, 21, 22, -2, 0); 
} catch(InvalidArgumentException $x) { 
    echo  $x->getMessage(); 
} // A two digit minute could not be found
```

Create exceptions occurs on such negative values but not on overflow, to get exceptions on overflow, use `createSafe()`

```php
echo Carbon::create(2000, 1, 35, 13, 0, 0);
// 2000-02-04 13:00:00
echo "\n";

try {
    Carbon::createSafe(2000, 1, 35, 13, 0, 0);
} catch (\Carbon\Exceptions\InvalidDateException $exp) {
    echo $exp->getMessage();
}
// day : 35 is not a valid value.
```

Note 1: 2018-02-29 produces also an exception while 2020-02-29 does not since 2020 is a leap year.

Note 2: `Carbon::createSafe(2014, 3, 30, 1, 30, 0, 'Europe/London')` also produces an exception as this time is in an hour skipped by the daylight saving time.

Note 3: The PHP native API allow consider there is a year `0` between `-1` and `1` even if it doesn't regarding to Gregorian calendar. That's why years lower than 1 will throw an exception using `createSafe`. Check [isValid()](https://carbon.nesbot.com/docs/#doc-method-Carbon-isValid) for year-0 detection.

```php
Carbon::createFromFormat($format, $time, $tz);
```

`createFromFormat()` is mostly a wrapper for the base php function [DateTime::createFromFormat](http://php.net/manual/en/datetime.createfromformat.php). The difference being again the `$tz` argument can be a DateTimeZone instance or a string timezone value. Also, if there are errors with the format this function will call the `DateTime::getLastErrors()` method and then throw a `InvalidArgumentException` with the errors as the message.

```php
echo Carbon::createFromFormat('Y-m-d H', '1975-05-21 22')->toDateTimeString(); // 1975-05-21 22:00:00
```

The final three create functions are for working with [unix timestamps](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time). The first will create a Carbon instance equal to the given timestamp and will set the timezone as well or default it to the current timezone. The second, `createFromTimestampUTC()`, is different in that the timezone will remain UTC (GMT), it acts the same as `Carbon::parse('@'.$timestamp)` but I have just made it a little more explicit. The third, `createFromTimestampMs()`, accepts a timestamp in milliseconds instead of seconds. Negative timestamps are also allowed.

```php
echo Carbon::createFromTimestamp(-1)->toDateTimeString(); // 1969-12-31 23:59:59
echo Carbon::createFromTimestamp(-1, 'Europe/London')->toDateTimeString(); // 1970-01-01 00:59:59  
echo Carbon::createFromTimestampUTC(-1)->toDateTimeString(); // 1969-12-31 23:59:59  
echo Carbon::createFromTimestampMs(1)->format('Y-m-d\TH:i:s.uP T'); // 1970-01-01T00:00:00.001000+00:00 UTC  
echo Carbon::createFromTimestampMs(1, 'Europe/London')->format('Y-m-d\TH:i:s.uP T'); // 1970-01-01T01:00:00.001000+01:00 BST
```

You can also create a `copy()` of an existing Carbon instance. As expected the date, time and timezone values are all copied to the new instance.

```php
$dt = Carbon::now(); 
echo  $dt->diffInYears($dt->copy()->addYear()); // 1  

// $dt was unchanged and still holds the value of Carbon:now()
```

You can use `nowWithSameTz()` on an existing Carbon instance to get a new instance at now in the same timezone.

```php
$meeting = Carbon::createFromTime(19, 15, 00, 'Africa/Johannesburg'); 

// 19:15 in Johannesburg  
echo  'Meeting starts at '.$meeting->format('H:i').' in Johannesburg.'; // Meeting starts at 19:15 in Johannesburg.  
// now in Johannesburg  
echo  "It's ".$meeting->nowWithSameTz()->format('H:i').' right now in Johannesburg.'; // It's 16:40 right now in Johannesburg.
```

Finally, if you find yourself inheriting a `\DateTime` instance from another library, fear not! You can create a `Carbon`instance via a friendly `instance()` method. Or use the even more flexible method `make()` which can return a new Carbon instance from a DateTime, Carbon or from a string, else it just returns null.

```php
$dt = new \DateTime('first day of January 2008'); // <== instance from another API
$carbon = Carbon::instance($dt);
echo get_class($carbon); // 'Carbon\Carbon'  
echo  $carbon->toDateTimeString(); // 2008-01-01 00:00:00
```

Carbon 2 (requiring PHP >= 7.1) perfectly supports microseconds. But if you use Carbon 1 and PHP < 7.1, read our[section about partial microseconds support](https://carbon.nesbot.com/docs/#partial-microseconds-support-v1).

Ever need to loop through some dates to find the earliest or latest date? Didn't know what to set your initial maximum/minimum values to? There are now two helpers for this to make your decision simple:

```php
echo Carbon::maxValue(); // '9999-12-31 23:59:59'  
echo Carbon::minValue(); // '0001-01-01 00:00:00'
```

Min and max value mainly depends on the system (32 or 64 bit).

With a 32-bit OS system or 32-bit version of PHP (you can check it in PHP with `PHP_INT_SIZE === 4`), the minimum value is the 0-unix-timestamp (1970-01-01 00:00:00) and the maximum is the timestamp given by the constant `PHP_INT_MAX`.

With a 64-bit OS system and 64-bit version of PHP, the minimum is 01-01-01 00:00:00 and maximum is 9999-12-31 23:59:59\. It's even possible to use negative year up to -9999 but be aware you may not have accurate results with some operations as the year 0 exists in PHP but not in the Gregorian calendar.
